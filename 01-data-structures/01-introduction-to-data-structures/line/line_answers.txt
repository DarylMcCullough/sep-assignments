# Questions about my data structures:

## Q1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

#### Manipulating data
In my implementation of lines, I provided the following operations for manipulating lines:
1. Creating a new line.
2. Adding a member to the end of the line.
3. Removing something from the middle of the line.

#### Accessing data
In addition, I provided the following operations for inspecting lines:
1. Check what members are at the front, middle and end of the line.
2. Check whether a member is in the line, and if so, at what index.

These operations cover all the normal cases where one would like to operate on 
or inspect a line representing someone waiting their turn for something. The one
thing that isn't directly supported, because it doesn't come up in normal use,
is the capability to get a listing of every one in line.


## Q2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, 
how would you search for it?

For my implementation of lines, the elements are members (represented by their 
names). There are two operations to find a particular member:

1. search, which tells whether a particular person is in the line.
2. index, which returns the person's place in line, if he is on the line.


## Q3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

The line can be used to represent any situation in which there is a linear ordering
of objects, and where there are notions of moving up in line. 
* It could represent the line of succession for some position, such King or President.
* It could represent  the order of customers to be served:
    * waiting to get into a movie
    * waiting to get a table at a restaurant
    * waiting to get a haircut, etc.
