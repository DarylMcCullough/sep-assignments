# Questions about mystack

## Q1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

#### Manipulating data
In my implementation of stacks, I provided the following operations for manipulating lines:
1. Creating a new queue. `MyStack.new`
2. Adding an item to the end of the queue. `stack.push(item)`
3. Removing the first item from the queue. `stack.pop`

#### Accessing data
In addition, I provided the following operations for inspecting the stack:
1. Check what the last item is. `stack.top`

## Q2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, 
how would you search for it?

The primitive stack operations don't support search, unless the developer just keeps
popping until the element shows up (which is destructive).

## Q3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

A stack represents a situation in which there are a sequence of tasks to be 
performed, and (contrary to a queue), the latest task has to be completed (and 
popped) first. An example is stacking serving plates; when you take a plate,
you always take the last one stacked, because that's on top.
