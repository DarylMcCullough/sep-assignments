# Questions about myqueue
(Almost the same answers as for line.rb)

## Q1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

#### Manipulating data
In my implementation of queues, I provided the following operations for manipulating lines:
1. Creating a new queue. `MyQueue.new`
2. Adding an item to the end of the queue. `queue.enqueue(item)`
3. Removing the first item from the queue. `queue.dequeue`

#### Accessing data
In addition, I provided the following operations for inspecting lines:
1. Check what the last item is. `queue.tail`
2. Check what the first item is. `queue.head`

## Q2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, 
how would you search for it?

The primitive queue operations don't support search, unless the developer just keeps
dequeuing until the element shows up (which is destructive).

## Q3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

The queue can be used to represent any situation in which there is a linear ordering
of objects, and where there are notions of moving up in line. 
* It could represent the line of succession for some position, such King or President.
* It could represent  the order of customers to be served:
    * waiting to get into a movie
    * waiting to get a table at a restaurant
    * waiting to get a haircut, etc.
